<h1>GraphicsEngine3D</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
A simple 3D "Graphics Engine" created entirely in C++ using OpenGL, GLM, GLEW and the stb_image.h library.

<h2>INFORMATION</h2>
The program is written in the C++ object-oriented language using OpenGL, GLM, GLEW and the stb_image.h library.
The graphics used as sample textures are not mine. The engine is very simple and I doubt it will be useful to anyone.
