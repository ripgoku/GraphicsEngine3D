<h1>GraphicsEngine3D</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
A simple 3D "Graphics Engine" created entirely in C++ using OpenGL, GLM, GLEW and the stb_image.h library.

<h2>INFORMATION</h2>
The program is written in the C++ object-oriented language using OpenGL, GLM, GLEW and the stb_image.h library.
The graphics used as sample textures are not mine. The engine is very simple and I doubt it will be useful to anyone.
If you want to work on it, you need to update the file paths in your IDE. All the necessary libraries are located in the "Linking" folder.
